Program Functionality Description:

The provided C++ program performs the following tasks:

1. User Interaction:
   - The program prompts the user to input the length of a list of numbers.
   - It then prompts the user to input the numbers for the list.

2. Prime Number Checker:
   - The program defines a function to determine whether a given number is prime.
   - It checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

3. Chosen Numbers Selection:
   - The program processes the list of numbers.
   - It identifies numbers that meet specific criteria:
       - The number is even.
       - The number is divisible by 3 and 6.
       - The number is a prime number.
   - The program keeps track of the count of chosen numbers meeting these criteria.

4. Probability Calculation:
   - The program calculates the probability of selecting a number from the list that meets the criteria.
   - It uses the count of chosen numbers meeting the criteria and the total number of input numbers.
   - The calculated probability is displayed as a percentage.

5. Output Display:
   - The program outputs the list of chosen numbers that satisfy the given conditions.
   - It displays the calculated probability of selecting a qualifying number.

The program showcases basic programming concepts such as user input, function definition, loop iteration, conditional statements, mathematical calculations, and output display. It provides users with the chosen numbers meeting specific conditions and demonstrates the concept of calculating probabilities.
